# FOAFW-feature-weighting-using-FOA
Java code for feature weighting using Forest Optimization Algorithm (FOAFW)
This is a Java implementation of feature weighting using Forest Optimization Algorithm.
Please be considered that you should add weka.jar as a library in your java code to run the code.
The program test for Cleveland.arff file (file format for weka). You can test for other datasets by just changing the file name in "initialization" function and set the parameters accordingly in the "global.java" file.
The implemented java program relates to the article "Ghaemi, Manizheh, and Mohammad-Reza Feizi-Derakhshi. "Forest optimization algorithm." Expert Systems with Applications 41, no. 15 (2014): 6676-6687."
The code employs KNN classifier of Weka package.
